        "answer": "The process of buying a property in Dubai is relatively straightforward. Once you have found a property you wish to purchase, you will need to pay a reservation fee to secure the property. This is usually 5-10% of the purchase price. You will then need to appoint a conveyancer to handle the legal aspects of the purchase. Once the legal checks have been completed, you will need to pay the remaining balance of the purchase price, as well as any associated fees. Once the purchase has been completed, the property will be transferred into your name and you will be the legal owner."
